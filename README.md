# Wealth of Nations Dataset Analysis 🌐💰

Welcome to the Wealth of Nations Dataset Analysis repository! In this project, I delved into the fascinating realm of economic data using the Wealth of Nations dataset. Leveraging the power of Excel and Tableau, I explored, analyzed, and visualized key insights to uncover the economic landscapes of various countries. Let's take a closer look at what this project entails.

## Project Overview 📊🔍

The Wealth of Nations dataset serves as the backbone of this analysis, providing a comprehensive view of economic indicators across different countries. To make sense of this wealth of information, I utilized two powerful tools: **Excel** and **Tableau**.

### Excel Magic ✨📈

In the Excel phase of the project, I employed a variety of techniques to wrangle and analyze the data:

- **Filtering:** I utilized Excel's robust filtering capabilities to focus on specific subsets of data, allowing for a more detailed analysis of particular economic aspects.

- **Data Type Transformation:** Ensuring accurate data representation is key. I adjusted data types to guarantee precision in calculations and visualizations.

- **Chart Creation:** Charts are worth a thousand words. I created visually appealing charts to highlight trends, patterns, and disparities in economic data.

- **Macro Magic:** To streamline repetitive tasks and enhance efficiency, I implemented macros to automate processes, making the analysis smoother and more accessible.

### Tableau Tales 📊📰

Moving beyond Excel, I harnessed the power of Tableau to elevate the analysis to the next level:

- **Relationships:** Establishing meaningful relationships between different data sets is crucial. In Tableau, I created robust relationships to connect disparate pieces of economic information.

- **Dashboard Design:** The ultimate goal is to make complex data easily understandable. I crafted interactive dashboards in Tableau, providing an immersive experience for users to explore the economic landscape of different countries.

- **Top 20 Wealthiest Countries:** One of the highlights of this project is the creation of a dashboard showcasing the top 20 wealthiest countries. This visual masterpiece encapsulates key economic indicators, offering a snapshot of global economic prowess.
